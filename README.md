# React Storefront v6 Spree Connector

This connector does not work with React Storefront v8+!! We share it so that someone in the community can port it over to v8 using the [Creating a Connector](https://docs.reactstorefront.io/guides/connectors#section_creating_your_own_connector) guide.

## Setup

- Add `react-storefront-spree` to your project
- When developing locally you will need to add `spree_domain`, `spree_storefront_access_token`, `spree_api_prefix`, `spree_access_token`, and `spree_client_id` to your `blob.dev.js` file in order for this module to query the spree API's

### Usage

## Changelog

### 1.1.0

- Added proper admin api endpoint
